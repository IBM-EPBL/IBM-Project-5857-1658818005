Tip of the day
Ask : what to submit in sprint 1,2,3,4?
Solution:
Sprint 1: simulation creation(connect sensor arduino with python code)

Sprint 2: software (create device in the iot watson platform, workflow for iot scenarios using local node red)

Sprint 3: mit app inventor, dashboard (application for your project using mit app, design the model and test the app)

Sprint 4 : web ui (to make the user interact with the software)
